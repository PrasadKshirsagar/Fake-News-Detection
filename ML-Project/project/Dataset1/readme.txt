This folder contains the first type of dataset that is used in our code.
'articles1.csv' and 'fake.csv' contains the original dataset used in our code representing true news articles and fake news articles.  
'dataset1.txt' is the training dataset containing 12,000 training examples with each example having 5000 attributes plus the label column at the end. So, it's essentially a matrix of 12000x5001 containing 0s and 1s.

'dataset2.txt' is the testing dataset containing 6,000 examples with each example having 5000 attributes plus the label column at the end. So, it's essentially a matrix of 6000x5001 containing 0s and 1s.

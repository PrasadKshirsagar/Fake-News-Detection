This folder contains the second type of dataset that is used in our code.
This dataset contains the most indicative words used in the training and test set.

'NEW_myX' is the training dataset containing 12,000 training examples with each example having 200 indicative attributes plus the label column at the end. So, it's essentially a matrix of 12000x201 containing 0s and 1s.

'NEW_myX_test' is the testing dataset containing 6,000 examples with each example having 200 indicative attributes plus the label column at the end. So, it's essentially a matrix of 6000x201 containing 0s and 1s.

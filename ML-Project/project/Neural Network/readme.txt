This folder contains the code to implement Neural Network on the given dataset.

'main1.py' uses either Dataset1 or Dataset2 (hard-coded in the code) and runs it on model created by ourself. 

'nnbinary.py' uses either Dataset1 or Dataset2 (hard-coded in the code) and runs neural network on it. In-built code is used(from keras). 

Compatible with python3 in linux

Dependencies:
->	scipy
->	matplotlib
->	cv2
->	sys
->	keras
->	cvglmnet
->	numpy

use pip install dependency to install the missing dependency.
